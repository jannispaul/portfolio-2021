		"question": "How much does a website cost?",
		"answer": "Websites are like cars. Depending on the desired quality, features, and time frame, the price can vary greatly. The projects I do usually end up somewhere between 3,000 € and 10,000 €.",

		"question": "How long does it take to build?",
		"answer": "Just like the cost, the time frame will vary based on the desired results. Most of my projects take around 1 to 3 months from start to finish, and I’ll have a first draft of your website ready within 2 weeks. Looking for a fast turnaround? The more concrete ideas and material you have going in, the sooner I can start with design and development. Not sure where to start?  I can help you create a concept that aligns with your values and vision.",

		"question": "Can I edit the website myself?",
		"answer": "Most of my websites are developed with Webflow. This means that you can easily edit the copy and images once the site is live (and I can walk you through how that’s done).",
